# Hand-Gesture-Color-Filter-Bar-Path-Tracking-System
This project combines two unique applications powered by OpenCV for real-time visual tracking and manipulation:
Hand Gesture Color Filter
This component uses hand gesture recognition to dynamically change the colors of filters applied to live video feeds.

 # Bar Path Tracking for Lifting
This feature tracks the motion of a barbell (or any object) through a lifting video, providing detailed insights into its path and movement over time. Although designed for weightlifting, this can be adapted for tracking any moving object in videos—ideal for motion analysis, sports science, and personal training. The tool processes video frames using OpenCV to detect and visualize the object's trajectory, giving you a better understanding of its movement dynamics.

Both components are built using OpenCV, a powerful library for real-time computer vision, and are designed to work seamlessly with video input in dynamic environments.

# Key Features:
Hand Gesture Recognition: Intuitive interaction to modify color filters in real-time based on hand movements.

Bar Path Detection: Accurate tracking of an object’s motion, useful for lifting analysis or general object tracking.

OpenCV Powered: Utilizes OpenCV for robust and efficient computer vision techniques for real-time performance.

# Usage:
Interactive Art/Games: Modify video filters using simple hand gestures.
Sports Science & Training: Track and analyze bar path during lifting sessions for performance improvement.
General Object Tracking: Adaptable for tracking any object in a video, with the potential for many applications.
